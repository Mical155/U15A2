## User Requirements

- Clear navigation - Ensure that the navigation is accessible from any web page and that it has clear and easy to understand structure so that users can direct themselves easily.

- Responsive website design - Make sure that the new section of Hot Beans website is responsive and works as intended and offers an easy viewing experience for users on any device.

- Clear and engaging company overview - The introduction to Hot Beans for potential employees needs to be engaging and provides great detail in terms of the companies aims, goals and intentions. Would also be ideal to include the companies background or recent work.

- Current trainee profiles - Would also be ideal to include testimonials from existing trainee web developers that are apart of the company. This will allow current employees to share their experience at Hot Beans and to give users more of an idea of what work is performed at Hot Beans.

- Professional/organized website design - Ensure that the website is visually pleasing and professional as it is a web development company and would have a higher chance of appealing to web developers than the website looking very unorganized.

- Simple application process - It is important to make the online application process as simple as possible. This can be done by clearly outlining the steps to users and it must be user-friendly with clear instructions and relevant fields whilst also making sure they are steps that will gather key information about the user and their relation with web development.

- Links to web development courses - It is also important to integrate links to maybe certain YouTube video web development course so that users can develop their web development skills.

- Provides specifications and qualifications - The website should also provide users with a description on the job specifications and qualifications so they are aware of what the company expects of them and what is required to join the team.

## Developer Requirements 

- Easy to understand code - Ensure that the code is easy to use and has good readability so that it will be easier to go back through and make any changes if needed.

- Code maintainability - Ensure code is maintained by to make sure that the code can be easily read and modified by the developer at any time. This can be done by regularly run tests and updates to ensure the stability of the code.

- Code testing - Write tests to validate the functionality of the different components. This will ensure the entire system will work as it was intended to.

- Code compatibility - It is also important to ensure the code is compatible and works on different browsers and devices. This can be done by conducting compatibility testing. 

- Leaving comments - Leaving comments within the code will make it much easier for the developer to understand what the intentions are in different parts of the code and make it more simple to navigate through the code.

## Web page storyboards + Justifications

In order to put my ideas for the websites appearance into visual perspective, I created some storyboards so to give an idea of what the storyboard can potentially look like.

### Home page

![Alt text](../assets/storyboards/HomePage.png)

#### Content design: 

|   | A  | B  | C  | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type  | Nav bar  | Header  | Text Box  | Video Link  | Background |
| Width  | 100%  | 300px  | 900px | 900px | Web page width |
| Height  | 80px  | 125px  | 1150px  | 600px  | Web page height |
| Color  | #000000 | #FFFFFF  | #FFFFFF | Default colors  | #FFD6D6 |

I have decided to have this as my main design for the Hot Beans home page for a number of reasons. Firstly, this design achieves two of the clients requirements and that is showcasing a clear company overview as it contains a decently large section on introducing the company to users, plus it contains a video link that will direct users to web development courses which achieves in having web development video links. Secondly, I believe the nav bar achieves the requirement of having simple navigation since the names of web pages are specific and there isn't too many options to make it complex. Finally, the overall layout and the color scheme is neat and achieves in making the website visually organized and professional.

### Our staff page

![Alt text](../assets/storyboards/OurStaffProfilesPage.png)

#### Content design:

|   | A  | B  | C  | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type  | Nav bar  | Header  | Image  | Text box  | Background |
| Width  | 100%  | 300px  | 500px  | 1000px  | Web page width |
| Height  | 80px  | 125px  | 450px  | 450px  | Web page height |
| Color  | #000000 | #FFFFFF  | Default RGB image colors | #FFFFFF  | #FFD6D6 |

I have chosen this as my main design since it looks very appealing and professional which is one of the main user requirements listed. Firstly, it achieves in having clear navigation as I have made sure that it is also accessible for users on this page and has the same layout as it would on any other page. Secondly, the color scheme looks very professional and all of the colors mix well with each other and are suitable for the content they're applied to. The layout is very organized and simplistic which achieves the requirement of having the website visually professional. This also achieves showcasing the trainees experience at Hot Beans since the web page very clearly showcases it with the addition of the trainees personal profile image.

### Join our team page

![Alt text](../assets/storyboards/JoinOurTeamPage.png)

#### Content design:

|   | A  | B  | C  | D | E | F | G | H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type  | Nav bar  | Header  | Container  | Header  | Text box | Text box | Container | Background |
| Width  | 100%  | 300px  | 900px  | 300px  | 700px | 800px | 900px | Web page width |
| Height  | 80px  | 125px  | 600px  | 50px  | 30px | 200px | 400px | Web page height |
| Color  | #000000 | #FFFFFF  | #FFFFFF | #FFFFFF  | #FFFFFF | #FFFFFF | #FFFFFF | #FFD6D6 |

Here is the design I chose to be the main design for the 'Join our team' web page. Firstly, the main reason I chose this to be the main design is because of how well I  personally think it does at achieving the requirement of having a simple application process which is the main part that users will look for on this page, this makes it very user-friendly as it is straightforward and is clear as to what needs to be filled in. Secondly, it also includes the job specifications and qualifications that users will need to see which is a requirement for users and for the company as they need more recruits. Like other web pages, it also ensures that the nav bar is accessible and provides users with simple navigation to the other web pages, it has a very professional layout and organized layout whilst following the similar theme and color scheme as the other web pages.

## Alternate web page designs

Whilst creating the storyboards for the websites web pages, I ended up creating multiple potential designs for them. Here are the alternate designs I ended up not choosing due to a number of reasons as to why the ones I am using are much more suitable for achieving the clients requirements.

### Our Staff page (Alternate design)

![Alt text](../assets/storyboards/OurStaffProfilesPage(AlternateDesign).png)

#### Content design:

|   | A  | B  | C  | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type  | Nav bar  | Header  | Image  | Text box | Background |
| Width  | 100%  | 300px  | 900px | 900px  | Web page width |
| Height  | 80px  | 125px  | 650px  | 950px  | Web page height |
| Color  | #000000  | #000000  | Default RGB image colors  | #000000  | #FF6320 |

Here is the alternate design for the 'Our Staff' web page. Firstly, the color scheme is very different compared to the main design, this uses much more black by having it applied to the text boxes and headers and the background is also orange instead of a lighter pink. I believe the main design has a better color scheme as it contains a wider variety whilst looking more professional as the pink mixes with the white boxes much more nicely in contrast to orange and black.

Secondly, the layout of the web page is also different since the trainee profiles are in a row instead of a column. I believe the main design is better since the alternate design having them layed out in a row results in the images and text boxes being very compressed which can make spacing very odd for the text showcasing the trainees experience at Hot Beans which is something users will want to read. However, this does have the benefit of reducing the overall length of the web page reducing scrolling time for users but however considering the disadvantages, in my opinion, it is not worth it. 

### Join our team page (Alternate design)

![Alt text](../assets/storyboards/JoinOurTeamPage(AlternateDesign).png)

#### Content design: 

|   | A  | B  | C  | D | E | F | G | H | I | J |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type  | Nav bar  | Header  | Container  | Header  | Text box | Text box | Text boxes | Text box | Container | Background |
| Width  | 100%  | 300px  | 900px  | 300px  | 700px | 800px | 30px | 800px | 900px | Web page width |
| Height  | 80px | 125px  | 1000px  | 50px  | 30px | 200px | 30px | 200px | 400px | Web page height |
| Color  | #000000 | #000000  | #000000 | #FFFFFF  | #FFFFFF | #FFFFFF | #FFFFFF | #FFFFFF | #000000 | #FF6320 |

Here is the alternate design for the 'Join our team' page. Even though the form has a number of content that I will definitely consider including on the form in the main design, the layout in my opinion however makes it unable to achieve the requirement of making the application form process as simple as possible for users. This problem mainly stems from the phone number text boxes, it would be better to have it as one text box so that it saves users time of having to fill in each individual box for one number, so I will definitely add this idea onto the form into the main design. Also, the 'have any experience?' question is also another feature I may add onto the main design since it gives Hot Beans more valuable information on the users that can be potential recruits, plus its simple for users to fill in and not complex. 

Like the last alternate design, the color scheme isn't really suitable and doesn't go well with what is on the web page. It is definitely visually more professional to changed the black text boxes to white and swap the orange to the pink background used on the main designs.

## Personal Review of Website

After creating the website based off my chosen storyboards, I decided to make my own personal review on the current designs of the different web pages. Here I cover what requirements the current website achieves and future ideas that can be implemented for improvement.

### Home page:

![Alt text](../assets/img/other/HomePage1.png)

Firstly, I believe the home page gives off a very professional look for to users due to the simplistic layout and use of colors. The navigation at the top of the screen is also simple and easy to use to ensure that navigating through the website for users isn't complex. However, the search bar on the right-hand side can't be used yet as I haven't implemented the code for it to be functional yet, it would be best to have the search bar direct users to a notification that will explain this to make sure they're aware. The color scheme mainly consists of black and white with pink as the background. The text size is at a reasonable size which promotes readability and it uses 'Teko' sans-serf font style which is also readable and looks very suitable for a website based on web development. In my opinion, the 'About us' section on this page achieves the requirement of providing users with a clear and engaging company overview as it goes over many key details such as their mission statement, services offered and core values.

![Alt text](../assets/img/other/HomePage2.png)

Towards the bottom of the home page I have also included a youtube video link which is a web development course for users that view this website and want to develop their web development skills, in my opinion, this achieves the requirement of the website containing links to web development course videos. I also decided to add a footer at the bottom of the web page to highlight where the end of the web page is and to prevent copyright infringement as it contains the copyright icon next to Hot Beans.

### Our staff page:

![Alt text](../assets/img/other/OurStaffPage1.png)

Firstly, the 'Our staff' web page has a similar layout and color scheme to the home page which is great as it proves the website maintains consistency throughout in terms of its design. However, one issue I did notice is the header 'Our current trainees' being off-centre, I have made sure to note this down and edit it to be more centered in future. Secondly, the trainee profiles are the main focus on this web page and personally I think they are great at showcasing current trainees experience at Hot Beans to give potential trainees viewing the website a better understanding of what Hot Beans expects from its employees and what work is performed, this is also one of the requirements which I believe it achieves.

![Alt text](../assets/img/other/OurStaffPage2.png)

The trainee profiles continue towards the end of the web page and they all provide the users insight onto current trainees experiences at Hot Beans. At the bottom of the page is the same footer with the same copyright information to prevent copyright infringement. The bottom of the ends pretty much the same as the home page and the overall design of the web page stays consistent throughout as it uses the same design choices used on the home page and others. 

### Join our team page:

![Alt text](../assets/img/other/JoinOurTeamPage1.png)

Firstly, the top of the 'Join our team' web page consists of the same nav bar as the other pages in the website which proves the website maintains its consistency and it also improves the overall navigation since the nav bar is accessible on all web pages. The first piece of content users will be greeted to is a form for them to fill out if they want to join Hot Beans team, the form contains what was mentioned on the storyboard which is an email address, password and a 'Why do want to join us?' box. I also included other content that was on the alternate storyboard design as I thought they would be suitable to have on the user form, the new additions are a phone number and 'Have any experience?' box. I chose all of these to be included within the user form as I believe they achieve the requirement of having a simple application process with user-friendly steps and they are also steps that will have the user fill in relevant information related to web development. However, one issue I did notice with the form is the 'Why do you want to join us?' box will have any text start from the middle instead of from the top, I will make sure to edit this to make sure it starts from the top in future. The submit button at the bottom of the form doesn't functionally work like the search button on the nav bar, for now I will also have this direct users to a notification explaining this hasn't been implemented yet when clicked on.

![alt text](../assets/img/other/JoinOurTeamPage2.png)

At the bottom of the web page is simply a section that showcases the job specifications and qualifications for being a web developer at Hot Beans. This part of the web page follows the same design as the rest of the web page and other web pages within the website. I believe this achieves the user requirement of providing clear specifications and qualifications required to join Hot Beans team, this is because it is able to highlight exactly what experience Hot Beans wants proof of and what technologies they expect users to have knowledge of and the exact qualifications needed. It also clearly covers what you'll be responsible for and is very descriptive about the users role as a web developer.

## Website Testing

### Compatibility:

To test the compatibility of the website I would take this website onto different browsers to make sure it will render as intended. This ensures that the website can be used on multiple browsers so it can be accessible to different users that use different browsers. The browsers I chose to test the website on were Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox.

#### Here is the website rendered in on these browsers:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/WebsiteGoogle.png)

![alt text](../assets/img/other/WebsiteEdge.png)

After confirming that the website worked on different browsers, I would then test it out on a phone to see how it renders on a smaller screen. When it rendered in I could see that there were some issues with the design. The website
still functionally works well and works as intended, however the layout and design do have some issues dut to the compression of the web page since it is on a smaller screen. The compression of the web page mainly affected the nav bar, headers, video sizing, form positioning and the footer. Despite the issues with layout, the website still functionally works as intended but in future changes I will edit this so the website will look more visually pleasing on a phone screen.

#### Here are the issues with layout on the compressed web page:

Nav bar issue

![alt text](../assets/img/other/NavBarIssue.png)

Here it is cleat that the items within the nav bar become off-centred when the wbe page is compressed and the text stacks on top of each other. The items still take the user to the requested web page as intended.

Header issue

![alt text](../assets/img/other/HeaderIssue2.png)

It is clearly visible here that the header is very off-centred when the web page is compressed and it looks more out of place from the rest of the content within the web page. However, the text within the header container is still in the center as intended.

Video sizing issue

![alt text](../assets/img/other/VideoSizingIssue.png)

As we can see from this image the video has been made extremely thin due to the compression of the web page and it will reduce the size of the video whilst playing, this then reduces overall usability since it is more difficult for users to watch it since the video is smaller in size. Yet again it still functionally works and is able to be played and it is only the size that needs to be changed in future.

Form positioning issue

![alt text](../assets/img/other/FormPositioningIssue.png)

From this image we can see the form is not contained within the screen after the web page is compressed. This leads to the overall positioning oif the form looking completely off so in future I will have to reposition the form.

Footer Issue

![alt text](../assets/img/other/FooterIssue.png)

Here it is clear that the footer is definitely affected by the web page compression since the text goes off screen. This also leads to users having to scroll to the right to see the entire text which isn't user-friendly. In future, I will have to change this by editing the code to make the text remain in the centre when the web page is compressed.

### Functionality:

From my testing, I believe the website definitely does prove that it has some good functionality. Examples of good functionality is the functional navigation system as it flawlessly navigates users to their requested web pages. The embedded youtube video also works as intended and provides users with valuable information on learning web development in order to become trainees for Hot Beans. The form on the 'Join Our Team' web page allows users to write their answers within the provided text boxes and is a simple and easy to complete process for them, users can also shrink and expand the text boxes if they need to. Plus, buttons that are on the website are highlighted when hovered over to indicate they are intractable which is great for preventing users from missing them, examples of this are the items on the nav bar, the search button next to the search bar and the submit button on the form.

Although there many examples of great functionality on my website, there are a few areas that need improving. Firstly, the search button used for searching for something put in the search bar ins't functional yet, it would be ideal to add a notification for when users click on it to notify them that the search buttons functions haven't been implemented yet. Secondly, the same thing should be done for the submit button on the form as it isn't functional yet and doesn't submit the information the user has entered. Plus, to also ensure better functionality, I will also have to fix the compression issues on the mobile version of the website as it looks visually unappealing and can prove to be a nuisance on smaller screen.

### Usability:

The website shows many examples of it having great usability and ease of use for users that view and use it. Firstly, the navigation of the website is easy to use and simple for users to understand as the nav bar is accessible on every web page, doesn't have too many web pages and each web page has a specific name that helps users identify which web page contains certain content. Secondly, the text boxes on the form are able to be expanded and shrunk by users promotes usability as it allows users to see text a lot better as they can expand the box in the case of the box being overloaded by text they are adding in. 

![alt text](../assets/img/other/FormTextBoxes.png)

The overall size of containers on the web pages promote usability as it provides enough space for the text to be visually organized and therefore making it easier for users to read. The text boxes on the staff profiles also showcases good usability since the text gets placed underneath the staff images to ensure good readability after the compression of the entire web page.

![alt text](../assets/img/other/StaffProfiles.png)

Although the website shows great usability, like functionality, there are areas that do require some improvement. Firstly, the compression issues mentioned already will bring usability issues as the compression will reorganize text and over compress it which makes it more difficult for users to read it. Secondly, the compressed video size on the mobile version makes it harder for users to view the video as the video is smaller in size and it is also harder to interact with as the buttons are reorganized. 

## Feedback from others

In order to gain more of an idea of what I should be improving about the website, I decided to gain feedback from other people that can view the website and is use it for themselves. This information will help me make improvements on the websites overall functionality, compatibility and usability.

### 1st Feedback

The website design is commendable, with its well-chosen colour scheme and typography enhancing accessibility. The overall layout facilitates easy comprehension and seamless navigation, contributing to a positive user experience. However, when the home page is resized, the text within the text boxes becomes misaligned or overflows, potentially causing frustration for users trying to read the content. This issue could lead to a disjointed browsing experience, hindering engagement and comprehension. - Luke Mauger

Personally, I  agree with this piece of feedback for a number of reasons. Firstly, the reasoning is valid as the overflow of text due to the web page compression can definitely reduce the overall readability. Secondly, the repositioning of content can definitely make it frustrating for users and reduce the overall engagement. It will definitely be important for me to change this to ensure the content is visually more organized after the web page is compressed to a smaller size.

### 2nd Feedback

The website for Firefox works as intended, when resizing it does have some issues correctly positioning labels and squishes text offscreen. Images are also affected which makes them squished. The mobile version is not functioning as nearly nothing was intractable & had size/positioning issues. Other than those issues, the site looks great, the color scheme is nice and not too overbearing on the eyes, the buttons could use a bit of highlighting when not hovering over them to give me the sense they can be clicked on. - Aiden Scowen

In my opinion, I also very much agree with this piece of feedback. Firstly, when it mentions the resizing issues I completely understand for the same reasons as the last feedback because it would reduce readability of text, usability and functionality, plus it proves the website isn't very compatible on mobile devices as the content can't compress properly. Also, I personally disagree with the button highlighting since I have made sure they are all highlighted when users hover over them with the cursor to indicate they can be intractable. In conclusion, I will make sure that the changes I make in future will be towards the resizing and repositioning of content after the web page compression, this is to ensure the website is compatible on mobile devices with smaller screens and it maintains its functionality and usability.

## Optimizing the website

Based off the feedback, testing and the personal review of the website, I decided to make a number of improvements to the website to ensure it meets the clients requirements and has great functionality, compatibility and usability. 

### Form issue fix

One of the first things I made changes to was the form, my goal was to fix the issue it had with the text boxes that the users can fill in. The issue was that it made users start from the middle of the box instead of from the top. This issue would make the layering and positioning of text very awkward and it would be very unappealing for users and therefore it would reduce usability and functionality.

Before:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/FormIssue.png)

After:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/FormIssue(After).png)

As you can see, the text now starts from the top as it should do instead of from the middle. This proves to users that the website has great functionality as the text boxes work as intended. This change also helps the website to achieve the requirement of users having a simple and easy application process without any errors or interruptions.

### Header issue fix

Based off of the personal review of the website, one of the issues I mentioned was text of the header being off-centre in the container. I would change this by repositioning the text so it's more in the centre to make it more visually appealing to users. I would also make sure it is centred when the web page is compressed to ensure it is centred on mobile devices which promotes compatibility.

Before: 

![alt text](../assets/img/other/HeaderIssue.png)

After:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/HeaderIssue(After).png)

As you can see, the text within the container is in the centre and I have also added more text onto the header so it fills up the white space within the container. This change ensures good functionality and compatibility since the header is positioned as intended on both PC and mobile devices.

### Footer issue fix

This change was a result of the website testing results, whilst testing the website I mentioned how the footer is completely off screen when the web page is compressed which is an example of poor functionality and it isn't compatible for mobile devices. I would then edit the code to make sure the footer is no longer off screen and instead perfectly in the centre of the web page wether the web page is compressed or not.

Before:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/FooterIssue.png)

After:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/FooterIssue(After).png)

As you can see from the changes it is definitely a massive improvement, the text is perfectly in the centre of the web page even when the web page is compressed which ensures compatibility and functionality. I have even reduced the size of the text as that was part of the reason as to why the text was going off screen.

### Text box compression issue fix

As a result of the first feedback received where it mentions compression issues with text boxes which leads to text overflow, I would make changes to the website in order to fix this problem as I am aware that it reduces the compatibility of the website since it makes it more frustrating for mobile phone users. The overflow of text makes the positioning and layering very odd and it reduces the readability since the text is very unorganized within a compressed space.

Before:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/HeaderIssue2.png)

After:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/CompressionIssue(After).png)

From the images it is clear that the text box has a lot more space which has lead to the text not overflowing which promotes readability and usability. Plus, the header is more inline with the text box underneath after compression which achieves the requirement of having a responsive website and professional design/layout. 

### Video sizing issue fix

From the second feedback I was informed that the video has sizing issues since it would be extremely small and distorted whilst playing whilst the web page is compressed to a smaller size. I would make sure in the changes that the video is much more wider to prevent distortion due to the thin size as a result of the web page compression. This change would improve the compatibility of the website.

Before:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/VideoSizingIssue.png)

After:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/VideoSizingIssue(After).png)

From the images we can see that the video is much larger than what was originally which is great as it reduces distortion which then promotes usability as it is easier for users to watch the video on mobile devices. This also achieves the requirement of having a fully functional video that provides users with a course on web development to improve their skills.

### Search and submit buttons

As I've mentioned multiple times in the personal review and testing, the search button on the nav bar and the submit button on the application form are not yet functional as I haven't been able to implement the code yet. I saw that it would be necessary to direct users to a web page with a notification informing them that part of the website hasn't been implemented yet. It would allow users to know that it is simply because of that part not being implemented yet instead of them assuming it to be an error with the website

Here is the added message:

![alt text](../assets/img/other/AddedMessage.png)
